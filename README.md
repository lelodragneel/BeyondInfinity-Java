Text Based Adventure Role-playing
CSCI1101 Project

Desc:
A player would read some text and be able to make decisions and it would allow the player to customize the adventure. A neat twist would be to add "mistakes" or "errors" so that if a player chooses some combination (not just a singular event) then they will die, or their adventure is over and the game should backtrack the first choice which attributed to the mistake.
